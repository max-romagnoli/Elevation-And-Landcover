# Impact of Elevation on Landcover around Killarney

<img src="resources/NLM-vs-DTM.jpg" width="800">

This repo contains the code used to run statistical analysis on the geo-datasets that I produced in ESRI ArcGIS Pro. The tests serve as complementary evidence of the impacts that elevation has on landcover in an Area of Interest located around Killarney National Park (in Ireland).

These are the contents I uploaded:
- `anova.py` : runs the Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) test on a dataset of 10.000 random points generated within the Area of Interest and checks its result against a chosen significance level.
- `plots.py` : contains the code for plots that visualise the impact of elevation on landcover.
